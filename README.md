A collection of snippets to work with the LoadImpact API

I wrote a blog post for the Rackspace devops blog (http://developer.rackspace.com/blog/automating-load-testing.html)
But there was no way to include a complete sample in the original post so I set up this git repo to publish it.

Follow up articles are most likely to be published on the LoadImpact blog (http://blog.loadimpact.com)
